AES Crypt for Windows Installation Notes

Inside this ZIP file are two executable files:
  AESCrypt.msi
  setup.exe

To install AES Crypt, first try to install using "AESCrypt.msi".  This
should work on up-to-date Windows 7 and 8 systems.

If you receive an error indicating that you are missing some files,
execute "setup.exe".  This should install the required Microsoft library
files that are included in most up-to-date Windows systems.  It will
then also install AES Crypt for you.  (Note that executing "setup.exe"
when your system already has the required files will also produce an
error message.)
